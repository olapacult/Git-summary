## Git - what it is?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes 
in files, most commonly in the context of collaborative software development.
It was designed with key goals in mind: high performance, strong data integrity, 
and the ability to support distributed, non-linear workflows - allowing 
thousands of branches to be developed in parallel across multiple machines.


## Basic commands in Git

- **Starting a repository:**
    - Initialize a new Git repository `git init`
    - Clone an existing repository `git clone <url>` 

- **Saving changes**
    - Show current status of the working directory `git status`
    - Stage a file for commit `git add <file>`
    - Stage all changed files `git add .`
    - Commit staged changes with a message `git commit -m "Message"` 

- **Working with Remotes**
    - List remote repositories: `git remote -v` 
    - Push commits to remote repository: `git push`
    - Pull latest changes from remote repository: `git pull`  
    - Fetch changes from a remote repository without merging: `git fetch`


## Working with Branches in Git

Branches in Git are used to develop different features or changes independently 
from the main codebase. They allow you to make changes, test ideas, or 
fix bugs without affecting the working version of your project.

### Common Branch Commands

- **Create a new branch:**
`git branch <branch-name>`

- **Switch to another branch:**
`git checkout <branch-name>`

- **Create and switch to a new branch:**
`git checkout -b <branch-name>`

- **List all local branches:**
`git branch`

- **Delete a local branch:**
`git branch -d <branch-name>`

### Merging Branches
Merging a branch in Git combines the changes from one branch into another - typically 
to integrate new features or updates into the main codebase.

To merge changes from the selected branch into the current branch:
`git merge <branch-name>`

### Merge conflict

A conflict in Git occurs when changes made in two different branches are incompatible, 
meaning they affect the same part of the code in conflicting ways. This usually 
happens during a merge operation. 

How to resolve a merge conflict:

1. Git will indicate which files have conflicts after a merge attempt.
2. Open the conflicted files. Git marks the conflicting areas in the file with special markers 
(<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>), showing both versions of the code.
3. Manually edit the file to decide which changes to keep or how to combine them.
4. After editing, save the file and run git add <file> to mark the conflict as resolved.
5. Finally, commit the resolved changes with git commit to finish the merge process.
